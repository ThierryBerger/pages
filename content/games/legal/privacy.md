## Data Controller

Thierry Berger, auto-entrepreneur registered in France.

Contact: [legal@thierryberger.com](mailto:legal@thierryberger.com)

## Scope

This Privacy Policy applies to games developed by Thierry Berger (collectively, "the Games"), whether distributed through third-party platforms (such as TikTok, web browsers, or app stores) or any other channel. By using the Games you agree to the practices described in this policy.

## Data Collected

The Games do not directly collect, store, or process personal data on any server operated by the developer. User interactions occur within the hosting platform's environment.

Depending on the platform, the following data may be processed by third-party SDKs:

- **Platform user identifier** — used to authenticate you within the game (e.g. via TikTok Login APIs or other platform login services).
- **Ad interaction data** — generated when you view or interact with rewarded ads served through platform or third-party ad SDKs.
- **Basic usage data** — such as session events, collected automatically by the hosting platform.

The developer does not have direct access to, export, or independently store any of the above data.

## Legal Basis for Processing

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the legal bases for processing are:

- **Performance of a contract** (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR) — processing is necessary to provide the game service you have chosen to use.
- **Legitimate interest** (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) — processing is necessary to display rewarded advertisements that sustain the free-to-play model of the Games.

## Third-Party Data Processors

The Games may rely on the following third-party services, which act as independent data controllers or joint controllers for the data they process:

| Service | Provider | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| TikTok Login API | TikTok (ByteDance) | User authentication |
| TikTok Rewarded Ads SDK | TikTok (ByteDance) | Serving rewarded advertisements |

Additional third-party services may be used depending on the distribution platform. No third-party analytics or tracking services beyond those provided by the hosting platform are integrated into the Games.

For details on how each platform processes your data, please refer to their respective privacy policies (e.g. [TikTok's Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy)).

## Data Storage and Retention

The developer does not operate any backend server and does not store personal data. Any data retention is handled entirely by the hosting platform in accordance with their own data retention policies.

## Your Rights Under GDPR

As a data subject located in the European Economic Area, you have the following rights:

- **Right of access** — obtain confirmation of whether your personal data is being processed and request a copy.
- **Right to rectification** — request correction of inaccurate personal data.
- **Right to erasure** ("right to be forgotten") — request deletion of your personal data.
- **Right to restriction of processing** — request that processing of your data be limited.
- **Right to data portability** — receive your data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
- **Right to object** — object to data processing based on legitimate interest.
- **Right to lodge a complaint** — file a complaint with a supervisory authority. In France, the relevant authority is the [CNIL](https://www.cnil.fr).

Because the developer does not directly store personal data, most of these rights should be exercised directly with the hosting platform through their settings or privacy request channels.

If you have questions about your data as it relates to the Games, please contact:
